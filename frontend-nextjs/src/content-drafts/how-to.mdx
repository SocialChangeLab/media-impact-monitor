This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

Note that there is also a [Cheatsheet specific to Markdown Here](./Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) if that's what you're looking for. You can also check out [more Markdown tools](./Other-Markdown-Tools).

# React Components

You can use react components in your markdown files, which allow for more complex layouts and interactive pages.
Note that the React context is not available in the markdown file, so you cannot use components that rely on the React context.

Components must be imported from the `@/components` directory directly in the markdown file before they can be used. However, some components are always available without the need to import them. Those components are:
- Image (from `next/image`): Used to display optimized images in the markdown file (preferred over the `img` tag).
- CollapsableSection: Used to create collapsable sections in the markdown file.

For example, you can use the `Button` component to create an interactive button in your markdown file. Here's an example: 

```
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

<div className="w-full relative flex justify-center items-center">
  <div className="w-full border border-dashed border-grayLight p-8 rounded-lg bg-pattern-soft grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
    <Button variant="default" size="lg">
      Default large
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" size="lg">
      Outline large
    </Button>
    <Button variant="ghost" size="lg">
      Ghost large
    </Button>
    <Button variant="default">Default</Button>
    <Button variant="outline">Outline</Button>
    <Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
    <Button variant="default" size="sm">
      Default small
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
      Outline small
    </Button>
    <Button variant="ghost" size="sm">
      Ghost small
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>
```


**Result:**

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

<div className="w-full relative flex justify-center items-center">
  <div className="w-full border border-dashed border-grayLight p-8 rounded-lg bg-pattern-soft grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
    <Button variant="default" size="lg">
      Default large
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" size="lg">
      Outline large
    </Button>
    <Button variant="ghost" size="lg">
      Ghost large
    </Button>
    <Button variant="default">Default</Button>
    <Button variant="outline">Outline</Button>
    <Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
    <Button variant="default" size="sm">
      Default small
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
      Outline small
    </Button>
    <Button variant="ghost" size="sm">
      Ghost small
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>

# Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

# Links

There are two ways to create links.

```no-highlight
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

# Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
```
</code></pre>



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

<a name="footnotes"/>

# Footnotes

Footnotes aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they [supported by GFM](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes).

```no-highlight
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
```

<a name="tables"/>

# Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```no-highlight
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

# Blockquotes

```no-highlight

> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

# Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. 

```no-highlight
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

# Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend. 

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...

(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)

# YouTube Videos

This is how you embed a YouTube video:
```no-highlight
<iframe className="aspect-video w-full" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

<iframe className="aspect-video w-full" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PPWWRV6gbA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

They can be added directly but you can also add an image with a link to the video like this:

```no-highlight
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_PPWWRV6gbA
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/_PPWWRV6gbA/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```no-highlight
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_PPWWRV6gbA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWWRV6gbA)

Referencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1.
