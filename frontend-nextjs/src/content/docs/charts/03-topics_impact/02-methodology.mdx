For this chart, we used a simple keyword-based approach. When an article's fulltext matched at least one of the keywords associated with a topic, it was assigned to it.
The frequencies were obtained by querying the data source APIs. 

{/* How did we deal with multiple matches? Mutually exclusive? probably not*/}

âœ¦ **Hover** over the legend below the chart to see the respective keywords used to identify each topic.
