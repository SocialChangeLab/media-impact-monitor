The activists also accused the airport, the city and the state of greenwashing and dishonesty in fulfilling their legal climate protection mandate. Another group of Last Generation activists staged a protest at Marienplatz and distributed food previously taken from supermarkets' garbage containers to draw attention to the issue of food waste in the face of rising prices and increasing food shortages worldwide and to the lack of a legal framework to curb food waste.",
