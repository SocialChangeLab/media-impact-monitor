The **Sentiment Impact Chart** shows the results of our impact estimation analysis for each group within the selected time frame.

> NOTE: By selecting a longer time frame, you can improve the reliability of the impact estimate.

## In the chart

- **Colour of Arrows:** The colours correspond to the respective sentiments (see the Legend below the chart)
- **Length/Size of Arrows:** The arrows represent the _Confidence Intervals_ of our impact estimates
- **Vertical Y-Axis:** Shows the magnitude of the impact estimates (positive or negative)

> **Confidence Intervals**
> = It's a range that we believe, with 95% confidence, contains the true average impact of a protest within the time frame.
> 95% confidence means that out of 100 times we take a sample and calculate the average, roughly 95 times the true average will be within this range.
> The confidence interval gives you an idea of how much **uncertainty** there is in our estimate. A wider interval means more uncertainty, while a narrower interval means less.

## Interaction

- ☉ **Select** different organisations in the drop-down menus
- ✦ **Hover** over the arrows in the chart to see more statistical details (like the upper and lower bound of the impact range)
- ⌕ **Look** at the Impact Summaries below the chart for each organisation and sentiment

## Impact Summaries

As the name suggests, the 'Impact Summaries' provide a concise overview of the estimated impact on media coverage of an average protest by the selected organisation within the specified time frame.

How to interpret the results: 

- **"no clear evidence"**: This typically indicates that the estimate was not significant[^1] as the impact range (confidence interval) included zero. In other words, we cannot confidently determine if there was an effect.
- **"no impact"**: We confidently estimated that there was no impact within the selected time frame on average.
- **"shows increase/decrease"**: There was a significant positive or negative impact, and we will give you a range for the estimated impact size.



[^1]: At the standard 5% level of significance, a commonly accepted threshold in statistical analysis.
